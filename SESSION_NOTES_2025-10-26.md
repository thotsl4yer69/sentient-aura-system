## Important Reminders for Next Session

### 1. User Philosophy
> "Never compromise on anything short of the fully sentient core as we envisioned, no demos or temporary fixes, if a function does not work, we will fix it"

**Applied to Training:**
- No shortcuts on dataset quality (need full 200K+ examples)
- No placeholder models (train to >90% accuracy)
- No temporary detection logic (implement full RL-based decision policy)
- All functions must work as specified in training plan

### 2. Hardware Constraints
- 70 TOPS total compute (sufficient for all models)
- 32 GB RAM total (careful memory allocation required)
- Battery life critical for offensive/defensive ops
- Heat management on Pi 5 (active cooling recommended)

### 3. Legal/Ethical Considerations
- NFC/RFID training: ONLY use owned devices or with explicit permission
- WiFi jamming: Legal status varies by jurisdiction (emergency use only)
- GPS jamming: ILLEGAL (interferes with aviation/emergency services)
- User assumes all legal responsibility for ATHENA's actions

### 4. Integration Points
All new tactical modules must integrate with existing:
- `HybridEmotionModel`: Threat level → emotional state
- `HierarchicalMemory`: Store attack patterns, retrieve similar threats
- `MorphingController`: Visualize threats and countermeasures
- `SentientCortana`: Main orchestration pipeline

## Questions to Address Next Session

1. **Data Collection Strategy:**

   - Or rent GPU cluster? (faster, $8K cost)
   - Or use personal hardware for initial prototyping?

3. **Parallel Development:**

   - Or finish training first, then integrate?
   - Or implement core interfaces, then train incrementally?

4. **Testing Environment:**
   - Need controlled test environment for offensive/defensive ops
   - Legal considerations for NFC hacking tests
   - Jamming tests require isolated RF chamber (legal compliance)
